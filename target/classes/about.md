I created this app as part of the IBM Vaadin competition to learn and improve my Java skills. Prior to building this app, I had neither worked with BlueMix, Watson, Javax Persistence, OAuth or Vaadin. 

I threw myself in at the deep-end with the goal of using the Watson Visual Insights app to generate information from an Instagram feed.

For this I had to learn how to use OAuth to authenticate users and then retrieve and map their data into workable objects, which I later transfered into a JPA database. With all the Instagram data I thought it would be nice to see all the recent images on a map, especially for those keen travelers.

To display the data, I wanted to give users the option to see their Insights feedback in a variety of forms, tabular and a array of graphs.

**This app only reads your data from Instagram, using your most recent posts. It does not create or update any of your account data or posts.**

*If you are on a Public computer you will need to log out of Instagram after leaving the app.*
